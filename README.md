This is React based website that simulates modern day gym websites.

I've worked with ExerciseDB (RapidAPI), used hooks, functional components, materialUI...

Some of the options are: search of exercises, links to youtube videos, checking out similar exercises to the selected one and more.

Website is deployed on Netlify.
